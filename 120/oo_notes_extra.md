# Ruby OOP Notes Extra

### Objects
- The object's state is saved in an object's instance variables
- Instance methods can operate on the instance variables
- a Class object's first_name can be saved into a @first_name instance var as a string
- @first_name can hold any object (i.e. String, Hash, Array, or any other data structure)
